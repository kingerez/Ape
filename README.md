# Ape

The Ape API is how I thought a data-mocker API should look like. I needed it to create similar chunks of raw data for projects and tests, and thought it could be a good idea to share it with the rest of the world. I believe that the API I proposed here makes it simple and easy to create complex template-based JSON objects.

## Why Ape?
Because apes like to mimic (or "mock") real human behavior... ;)

## Usage
Use the Ape function to generate a new mock object. Ape receives a template object that is consisted of string keys and primitive or Ape operators as values.
